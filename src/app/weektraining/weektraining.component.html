        <p class="lead ">6 Week Industrial Training in Mohali</p>
        <p>As part of the engineering curriculum, students pursuing B.Tech or Polytechnic degrees are required to complete a six-week industrial training program in Chandigarh. The purpose of this program is to provide students with firsthand experience of the working environment in the industry, where they are likely to find employment after completing their degrees or diplomas.

            While theoretical knowledge is important, practical experience is also crucial for engineers. During their college years, students tend to focus on their textbooks, which is why the university/board mandates industrial training to expose them to live manufacturing and production units.
            
            Tech Engineer, based in Mohali, offers the best industrial training program with practical classes. We also offer stipend-based training to deserving candidates in Chandigarh. Our goal is to help students gain practical skills and knowledge that will enable them to succeed in their future careers.

 <b>Why most of Engineers are unemployed?</b><br>

  In India, there are numerous job opportunities available in the IT sector, yet many engineers struggle to secure their desired jobs. Upon analysis, it was found that most engineers lack practical technical skills, despite excelling in theory. Many students who score above 80% lack even basic installation knowledge, which makes it difficult for them to secure high-paying jobs in a highly competitive market. Many engineers focus solely on textbooks and exams, neglecting practical knowledge. Therefore, Tech Engineer offers the best 6-week industrial training in Chandigarh with hands-on live projects, providing students with real-life client project experience. This training goes beyond projects and viva, offering practical experience that is crucial to excel in the IT industry.
