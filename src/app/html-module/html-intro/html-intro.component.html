                <p>
                    HTML is an acronym which stands for <strong> Hyper Text Markup Language</strong> which is used for
                    creating web pages
                    and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hyper Text:</strong> HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it,
                    is a hypertext.
                    Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext.
                    HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Markup language:</strong> A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply
                    layout and formatting
                    conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn
                    text into images, tables, links, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Web Page:</strong> A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated
                    by a web browser. A
                    web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type.
                    <strong>With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.</strong>

                        In the late 1980's , a physicist, Tim Berners-Lee who was a contractor at CERN, proposed a
                        system
                        for CERN researchers. In 1989, he wrote a memo proposing an internet based hypertext system.

                        <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> is known as the father of HTML. The first available description
                        of HTML was a
                        document called "HTML Tags" proposed by Tim in late 1991. The latest version of HTML is HTML5,
                        which
                        we will learn later in this tutorial.

                        Since the time HTML was invented there are lots of HTML versions in market, the brief
                        introduction about the HTML version is given below:

                        <strong>HTML 2.0: </strong> This was the next version which was released in 1995, and it was
                        standard language version for website design. HTML 2.0 was able to support extra features such
                        as form-based file upload, form elements such as text box, option button, etc.
                    </p>

                        <strong>HTML 3.2: </strong> HTML 3.2 version was published by W3C in early 1997. This version
                        was capable of creating tables and providing support for extra options for form elements. It can
                        also support a web page with complex mathematical equations. It became an official standard for
                        any browser till January 1997. Today it is practically supported by most of the browsers.

                        <strong>HTML 4.01: </strong> HTML 4.01 version was released on December 1999, and it is a very
                        stable version of HTML language. This version is the current official standard, and it provides
                        added support for stylesheets (CSS) and scripting ability for various multimedia elements.

                        <strong>HTML 5: </strong> HTML5 is the newest version of HyperText Markup language. The first
                        draft of this version was announced in January 2008. There are two major organizations one is
                        W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), and another one is WHATWG( Web Hypertext Application Technology
                        Working Group) which are involved in the development of HTML 5 version, and still, it is under
                        development.
