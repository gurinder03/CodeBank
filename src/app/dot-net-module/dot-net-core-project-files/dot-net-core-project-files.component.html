                <h1>.NET Core - Project Files</h1>
                <p>In this chapter, we will discuss .NET Core project files and how you can add existing files in your
                    project.</p>

                <p>Let us understand a simple example in which we have some files which are already created; we have to
                    add these files in our FirstApp project. <br>
                    Here is the implementation of the Student.cs file
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="code-container px-4 p-3 bg-primary">
            </div>
            <p>Here is the implementation of the Course.cs file.</p>

            <div class="code-container px-4 p-3 bg-primary">
            </div>
            <p>Let us now save these three files in your disk and the source folder of your project.</p>

            <div class="versions p-4">
                <ul>
                    <li>Now if you are familiar with .NET and this one was a traditional .NET framework console
                        application, it is important to understand how to add these files in your project in Visual
                        Studio.</li>
                    <li>You first need to drag the files to the solution explorer to copy them in your project folder,
                        because your project needs reference to these files.</li>
                    <li>One of the benefits of .NET Core is the approach taken with the project file (project.json); we
                        can just drop files into the root of our project and then these will be automatically included
                        in our project.</li>
                    <li>We donâ€™t have to manually reference files like we did in the past for traditional .NET Framework
                        application in Visual Studio.</li>


                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Let us now open the root of your project.</p>

            <div class="code-container px-4 p-3 bg-primary">
            </div>
            <p>Let us now copy all of the three files into the root of your project.</p>
            <p>You can now see all the files copied to the root folder.</p>
            <p>Let us now go to Visual Studio; you will receive the following dialog box.</p>
            <div class="image-container p-4 text-center">

            </div>

            <p>Click <strong>Yes to All</strong> to reload your project.</p>
            <p>You will now that files are automatically included in your project.</p>
