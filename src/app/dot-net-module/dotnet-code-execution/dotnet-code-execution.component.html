                <p>In this chapter, we will understand the execution process of .NET Core and compare it with the .NET
                    Framework. The managed execution process includes the following steps.</p>

            <h2>Choosing a compiler</h2>
            <div class="code-execution p-4">
                <ul>
                    <li>It is a multi-language execution environment, the runtime supports a wide variety of data types
                        and language features.</li>
                    <li>To obtain the benefits provided by the common language runtime, you must use one or more
                        language compilers that target the runtime.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2 class="pt-3">Compiling your code to MSIL</h2>
            <div class="code-execution p-4">
                <ul>
                    <li>Compiling translates your source code into Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) and generates
                        the required metadata.</li>
                    <li>Metadata describes the types in your code, including the definition of each type, the signatures
                        of each type's members, the members that your code references, and other data that the runtime
                        uses at execution time.</li>
                    <li>The runtime locates and extracts the metadata from the file as well as from framework class
                        libraries (FCL) as needed during execution.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2 class="pt-3">Compiling MSIL to Native Code</h2>
            <div class="code-execution p-4">
                <ul>
                    <li>At execution time, a just-in-time (JIT) compiler translates the MSIL into native code.</li>
                    <li>During this compilation, code must pass a verification process that examines the MSIL and
                        metadata to find out whether the code can be determined to be type safe.</li>

                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2 class="pt-3">Running Code</h2>
            <div class="code-execution p-4">
                <ul>
                    <li>The common language runtime provides the infrastructure that enables the execution to take place
                        and services that can be used during execution.</li>
                    <li>During execution, managed code receives services such as garbage collection, security,
                        interoperability with unmanaged code, cross-language debugging support, and enhanced deployment
                        and versioning support.

            <h2 class="pt-3">.NET Core Code Execution Process</h2>
            <div class="code-execution p-4">
                <p>Now let’s relate how code executes with .NET Core as compared to .NET Framework. In .NET Core there
                    are many replacements of these components that are the part of the .NET Framework.</p>>
            </div>
            <div class="code-img p-4 text-center">
                <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dotnet_core/images/code_execution.jpg">
            </div>

            <div class="code-execution p-4">
                <ul>
                    <li>In .NET Core now we have a new series of compilers, like we have Roslyn for C# and VB.</li>
                    <li>You can also make use of the new F# 4.1 compiler if you want to use F# with .NET Core.</li>
                    <li>Actually these tools are different and we can use Roslyn with .NET Framework as well if we are
                        using C# 6 or later, because C# compiler can only support up to C# 5.</li>
                    <li>In .NET Core, we don’t have a framework class libraries (FCL), so a different set of libraries
                        are used and we now have CoreFx.</li>
                    <li>CoreFx is the reimplementation of the class libraries for .NET Core.</li>
                    <li>We also have a new run time with .NET Core known as CoreCLR and leverages a JIT Compiler.</li>
                    <li>Now the question is why do we have the reimplementation of all these components that we already
                        have in .NET framework.</li>
                    <li>So the answer is the same as why Microsoft implemented .NET Core.</li>
