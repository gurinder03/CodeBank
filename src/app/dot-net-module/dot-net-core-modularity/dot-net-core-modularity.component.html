                <h1>.NET Core - Modularity</h1>
                <p>It is another consideration of .NET Core to build and implement application that is modular. Instead
                    of installing the entire .NET Framework, your application can now just install what is required. Let
                    us go to the visual studio and see the modularity.
                </p>

                <p>Here is our simple .NET Core application, in Solution Explorer. Let us expand References and you will
                    see reference to .NETCoreApp
                </p>

            <div class="prerequisites pt-4 px-4">
                <p>Inside .NETCoreApp, you will see package reference to NuGet; let us expand it.</p>

            <div class="prerequisites pt-4 px-4">
                <p>You will see the whole series of NuGet Package references. If you have worked in .NET Framework, then
                    many of these namespaces will look familiar, because you are used to it by using in .NET Framework.
                </p>
                <p>.NET Framework is split into many different pieces and re-implemented with CoreFx; these pieces are
                    further distributed as individual packages.

                <ul>
                    <li>Now if you expand the NETStandard.Library, you will see addition references. You will even
                        notice System.Console which we are using in this application.</li>
                    <li>Now you donâ€™t have to bring in everything inside the .NET Framework, but just bring in what you
                        need for your application.</li>
                    <li>There are some other benefits as well; for example, these modules can be updated individually if
                        desired.</li>
