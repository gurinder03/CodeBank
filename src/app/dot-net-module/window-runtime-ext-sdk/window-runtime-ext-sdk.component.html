                <h1>Windows Runtime and Extension SDKs</h1>
                <p>Windows Runtime components are self-contained objects that you can instantiate and use from any
                    language, including C#, Visual Basic, JavaScript, and C++. In addition to the .NET Core meta-package
                    we saw in the previous chapter, UWP app also has a reference by default to a Universal Windows SDK.

                    Universal Windows is the reference to Windows Runtime and it has been factored into a series of APIs
                    contracts.

                <p>
                    The set of APIs within a device family is broken down into subdivisions known as API contracts. You
                    can find a list of different API contracts here
                    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn706135.aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn706135.aspx

                <p>
                    Most of those APIs inside windows runtime are factored into a single contract. Let us now search for
                    the Universal keyword on the API Contracts page.

                    You can see links to various APIs and you can also see the Universal family is so big that it has 12
                    pages of documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also search for phone API contract on this page.

                    Let us now click on the <b>Windows.Phone.PhoneContract</b> and scroll down; you will now see the
                    battery information of phone or the mobile device.

                    If you want to add this information on top of what you already have, then you should add the
                    references manually. Let us now go to the Visual Studio and right-click on the References in
                    Solution Explorer.

                <p>

                    You can now see the new reference category for Universal Windows; under this category there is Core

                        You can also see different versions. So, make sure you get the latest version to get the updated
